Hello Everyone!.<br>
My name is `Abdullah Alharbi`, Umm Al-Qura University Alumnus, majoring in computer engineering.
I learned cybersecurity through self-learning and have obtained several certifications from eLearnsecurity (eCPPTv2 and eWPT) and have studied the Security+ certification curriculum.
I also have more than 2 years of experience in cyber security, penetration testing and cyber security management, I discovered about 10 vulnerabilities and gave several courses in cyber security, benefiting more than 100 people, in which I received a recommendation.
I have some soft and technical skills that set me apart, scroll down to see my degree, accomplishments, and more.
After graduating, I aspire to be an expert in cyber security, especially in penetration testing, and to offer my skills and experience, albeit in a small way, to raise the level of protection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
